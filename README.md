# Overview

A website that is desktop and mobile-friendly that complements the University of Rochester (UR) website and mobile app by offering quick links and info to the most needed service. UR-Web-Hub introduces several potential new features such as down detection for doors and elevators, nutrition planning for dining, and course ratings, in addition to refining existing ones by eliminating the need to navigate through the UR site or download a native app. 

# Startup

To create the databases, run init__db.py

After you've done this, the Flask app is ready to be served.
